        <title>A Talk About Math Grad School</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As some of you know, I’m working on
	&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.math.cornell.edu/~reu/&quot;&gt;Cornell’s Summer Math Research Program for Undergrads&lt;/a&gt;
	this summer.
The program directors held a workshop/talk about what us undergrads should
	expect when applying to math grad school.
Most of us are rising juniors, with a smattering of rising seniors and sophomores.
I’m going to briefly lay out a schedule of what an aspiring math grad student
	should look forward to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing to do is the GRE, typically in the applicant’s junior year.
In 2014-2015, the tests were held on September 27th, October 25th, and April 18th.
There are also subject tests.
It seems like the Math subject test is the only one that matters for Math grad school.
The presenter didn’t linger on this topic.
It seems like GRE scores won’t help you, but can hurt you if they are low.
The presenter told a story of a promising Cornell math undergrad who didn’t study
	at all for the GRE. 
He had impressive coursework and some research, and seemed on track to get into one
	of the “big six” grad schools.
However, he completely bombed the GRE, and went to a second tier school as a result.
Apparently, we shouldn’t worry too much or to little about the GRE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our junior and senior years, we should work on developing a mix of general background (undergrad courses),
	expertise on specific topics (grad courses), and research experience (published papers).
Published papers are not necessary: the typical accepted applicant has published no papers.
They are tremendously helpful, however.
The most important thing is developing good relationships with professors, to write letters of recommendation.
Also, make sure that the trends on grades are good.
Good grades in sophomore and junior year are crucial; a few C’s in freshman year can be overlooked.
That’s really it for junior year, next comes the beginning of the application process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next part is choosing which schools to apply to.
By the fall of senior year, the applicant should have at least a vague idea of their specialty.
This is not meant to be a final idea, and it should not be constricting.
The big six graduate schools are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.math.harvard.edu/graduate/&quot;&gt;Harvard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://math.mit.edu/academics/grad/index.php&quot;&gt;MIT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.math.princeton.edu/graduate&quot;&gt;Princeton&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://math.berkeley.edu/programs/graduate&quot;&gt;Berkeley&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://mathematics.stanford.edu/academics/graduate/&quot;&gt;Stanford&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://math.uchicago.edu/graduate/&quot;&gt;U Chicago&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second tier (given by the presenter) are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.math.cornell.edu/m/Graduate/graduate&quot;&gt;Cornell&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lsa.umich.edu/math/graduate&quot;&gt;Michigan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.math.ucla.edu/grad&quot;&gt;UCLA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not meant to be an exhaustive list.
One word of caution: don’t &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; apply for the big six.
If you don’t get into any, then you might be left high and dry.
Apply to a mix of stretch, standard, and safety schools, like with college.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, the applicant should be writing the essays for their schools.
The essays, like the GRE scores, can disqualify you, but cannot help much.
DO NOT start your essay with :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/latex/latex-85ae7aa22102c50c1b36de4486198e96.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The essay should be a statement of interest, similar to the college admissions essay.
Talk about why you like math, and why you want to go to grad school.
If you can’t write about this, you should reconsider your motivations for going to grad school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your applications will be submitted in early January. 
Cornell returns decisions by February 1st.
The presenter told us that we should tell every college we have yet to hear
	from when we are accepted into another grad school.
This is good for the applicant, because the admissions officers will be thinking more about the strength
	of applicants than their yield rate, according to the presenter.
This is the time when it’s good to apply to a mix of stretch, normal, and safety options, because
	you don’t want to suddenly have to start interviewing for jobs
	with no warning if no graduate school accepts you.
To give an idea of the statistics, in 2015 Cornell had 250 applicants.
They admitted 30 of them, and 10 accepted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every grad school will have an official vising weekend, and will give the accepted students a small travel budget.
You can meet and talk with professors and especially current grad students.
They’re a good bellweather.
They are most often honest about the struggles that they face, and will tell you the strengths
	and weaknesses of that program honestly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve decided which program you want to accept (if any), that’s it!
Have fun in graduate school!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Math Notation with MathJax and Jekyll</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I am configuring Latex preprocessors for math blogging. 
The first one I’ve tried is MathJax, which does client-side rendering.
It seems slow on my laptop, but it is extremely simple.
I got it working in under a half an hour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found out about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flx.cat/jekyll/2013/11/10/liquid-latex-jekyll-plugin.html&quot;&gt;liquid latex&lt;/a&gt;
	from googling, but that website is very difficult to read.
Fortunately, they link to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/fgalindo/jekyll-liquid-latex-plugin&quot;&gt;github repo&lt;/a&gt;.
The repo is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License&quot;&gt;MIT Licensed&lt;/a&gt;, and the installation
	instructions direct me to copy &lt;code&gt;liquid_latex.rb&lt;/code&gt; to my &lt;code&gt;_plugins&lt;/code&gt; directory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fgalindo/jekyll-liquid-latex-plugin/master/liquid_latex.rb&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One minor point of confusion is that nobody told me that I would have to create my own &lt;code&gt;_plugins&lt;/code&gt;
	directory.
From there, the configuration instructions direct me to update my &lt;code&gt;_config.yml&lt;/code&gt;.
I copied the config information verbatum into my &lt;code&gt;_config.yml&lt;/code&gt;.
Unfortunately, it didn’t work when I copied in the defaults, but it worked with not config.  Strange.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, I tried it out:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/latex/latex-f9673c8b4558b99b074274d23832d428.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hooray!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Math Research</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This summer I’m going to be doing math research with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.math.cornell.edu/m/People/Faculty/strichartz&quot;&gt;Bob Strichartz&lt;/a&gt; this summer.  We’re going to be trying to develop a theory of analysis on fractals and other rough spaces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was the only summer program I applied to.
The previous summer, my mom got me a job working as a research assistant at
	catholic university’s vitreous state lab.
I wasn’t particularly productive there.
The one good thing that came of that was that I began reading textbooks independently.
I started out reading David Griffiths excellent Introduction to Quantum Mechanics textbook.
I might do a fuller review later, here’s a wonderful &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.physicspages.com/index-physics-quantum-mechanics/griffiths-introduction-to-quantum-mechanics-problems/&quot;&gt;set of commentary and solutions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve met many many other people who learned differential equations from griffiths.
It’s rather embarassing how common this is.
It could be that this is the first class in which solving differential equations is “expected” of us students.
Many of the people who I knew took differential equations (ex: Sascha) forgot everything about it,
	but everybody who’s used differential equations in quantum knows a thing or two about actually
	solving them.
The next best resource is definitely Farlow’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Differential-Equations-Scientists-Engineers-Mathematics/dp/048667620X&quot;&gt;Partial Differential Equations for Scientists and Engineers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, at the beginning of spring semester, I knew that I needed to apply to some sort of summer program.
I didn’t particularly want to, it was much more of a push than a pull.
I was afraid of not having anything to do during the summer.
When I was told that I missed the deadline for Cornell’s summer math program, I was carrying Vivian’s
	books at the time.
I dropped the books.
I then quickly talked to Bob and applied to his group, and I was fortunately accepted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a tremendous amount of difficulty working through the background reading, and now here I am starting
	the first real week of work after the background lectures.
Wish me luck!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Writing Jekyll blog posts with Vim and Git</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m going to lie to you in this blog post.  As you read this, I think that you’re assuming I sat down 
to write this (after some inspiration of course!) and then wrote the whole thing in one go.  At least, I 
bet that you thought that I wrote the beginning before the end.  Wrong.  Here’s the completed paragraph:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I sit down to write about &lt;a href=&quot;www.bro.ken&quot;&gt;making mathematica-style manipulate on the web&lt;/a&gt;, 
I come across a problem.  That problem is apostrophes.  Vim does some markdown syntax 
highlighting.  Right now vim is making the string “Writing Jekyll blog posts with Vim and Git”
appear red to me.  Now, I want to take a screenshot.  I am running ubuntu, with the (i3)[i3wm.org] 
window manager installed.  I google “screenshots ubuntu” (note that the text in quotes is red), and I get
an &lt;a href=&quot;http://askubuntu.com/questions/6558/what-screenshot-tools-are-available&quot;&gt;askubuntu post&lt;/a&gt; (which just 
taught me that &lt;code&gt;&quot;+p&lt;/code&gt; is the vim paste command), and the askubuntu post tells me that there is a tool called
&lt;a href=&quot;shutter-project.org&quot;&gt;shutter&lt;/a&gt; which lets me take screenshots on ubuntu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I know what to do:
&lt;code&gt;bash
$ sudo apt-get install shutter
...
After this operation, 32.3 MB of additional disk space will be used.
Do you want to continue? [Y/n] y
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just to be clear, the original goal of this was to make the vim syntax highlighting be sane about apostrophes
in markdown, and not treat them like they’re quotes.  To show you this problem, I’m installing a screenshot
tool.  I originally encountered this problem when trying to write another blog post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I type &lt;code&gt;$ shutter&lt;/code&gt; and looks like it has a gui.  Shit.  Close that.  Google “shutter
screenshots command line”.  A nice helpul &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.linuxstall.com/take-screenshot-in-linux-with-shutter/&quot;&gt;tutorial&lt;/a&gt; 
(so glad i didn’t have to type that whole url, because of the neat handy &lt;code&gt;&quot;+p&lt;/code&gt; command). 
It tells me that i need to execute &lt;code&gt;$ shutter --full&lt;/code&gt; to take a screenshot.  I do so, but a
notification pops up (that I can’t screenshot, sorry) telling me where it saved the screenshot.
The notification fades very fast.  Time to go hunting around my filesystem to see where the screenshot went.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;bash
$ ls ~
college dev Downloads Dropbox media res tmp work Workspace 2_001.png
&lt;/code&gt;
In order to get the above image, I’m trying to toy around with xclip.  I do &lt;code&gt;$ ls ~ | xclip -i&lt;/code&gt; (the ‘-i’
 is for in), and it works? Nope!  Not sure what’s wrong!  I won’t be, I’ve already wasted enough time 
that I just typed it manually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;lets-back-up-a-bit&quot;&gt;Let’s back up a bit.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I sit down to write about (making mathematica-style manipulate on the web)[www.bro.ken], 
I come across a problem.  That problem is apostrophes.  Vim does some markdown syntax 
highlighting.  Right now vim is making the string “Writing Jekyll blog posts with Vim and Git”
appear red to me.  Now, I want to take a screenshot.  I am running ubuntu, with the (i3)[i3wm.org] 
window manager installed.  I google “screenshots ubuntu” (note that the text in quotes is red), and I get
an &lt;a href=&quot;http://askubuntu.com/questions/6558/what-screenshot-tools-are-available&quot;&gt;askubuntu post&lt;/a&gt; (which just 
taught me that &lt;code&gt;&quot;+p&lt;/code&gt; is the vim paste command), and the askubuntu post tells me that there is a tool called
(shutter)[shutter-project.org] which lets me take screenshots on ubuntu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just pasted a paragraph from above, which means that I need to know how to copy and paste text in vim.
I know how to paste, not how to copy.  Google gets me 
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tech-recipes.com/rx/219/copy-and-paste-text-with-vi-or-vim/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; which might help.&lt;br /&gt;
Nope, let’s do &lt;a href=&quot;http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Copy,_cut_and_paste&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; instead.  The text is still interpreting 
anything posessive as a quote, making this crazy red.  But, I can embed pitures!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, wait, I’m using Jekyll.  I have to look up how to embed pictures.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?client=ubuntu&amp;amp;channel=fs&amp;amp;q=embed+pictures+in+Jekyll&amp;amp;ie=utf-8&amp;amp;oe=utf-8&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;
then &lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/&quot;&gt;the official jekyll site&lt;/a&gt; which says midway down that you can 
add in an image asset in a post.  I have to move the screenshot to assets (good get it out of my home 
directory!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;bash
$ ls ~/dev/jekyll-blog
about.md  _config.yml   css       _includes   _layouts  README.md  _site
about.md~ _config.yml~  feed.xml  index.html  _posts    _sass
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is assets in &lt;code&gt;includes&lt;/code&gt;? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;bash
~/dev/jekyll-blog$ ls _includes
footer.html header.html head.html
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assets is probably not in includes.  Do I have to create it?  Yes, back on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/&quot;&gt;official jekyll site&lt;/a&gt; it says that I need to make a directory called “something like &lt;code&gt;assets&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;downloads&lt;/code&gt;, into which any images, downloads, or other resources are placed.”  Okay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;~/dev/jekyll-blog$ mkdir assets&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;~/dev/jekyll-blog$ mv ~/Workspace\ 2_001.png assets&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;~/dev/jekyll-blog$ ls assets&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Workspace 2_001.png&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;~/dev/jekyll-blog$ mv assets/Workspace\ 2_001.png assets/red.png&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yay, it’s here.  It should appear below.
&lt;img src=&quot;http://christosilvia.github.io/assets/red.png&quot; alt=&quot;If it's not broken this should be an image&quot; /&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, I go to look and it’s not there.  Wtf.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe the directory needs to be named &lt;code&gt;_assets&lt;/code&gt; and not &lt;code&gt;assets&lt;/code&gt;?  That doesn’t fix it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;lets-start-over&quot;&gt;Let’s start over&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I sit down to write about (making mathematica-style manipulate on the web)[www.bro.ken], 
I come across a problem.  That problem is apostrophes.  Vim does some markdown syntax 
highlighting.  Right now vim is making the string “Writing Jekyll blog posts with Vim and Git”
appear red to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://christosilvia.github.io/assets/red.png&quot; alt=&quot;Ahaha sucker&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I give up.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Welcome to Jekyll!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;You’ll find this post in your &lt;code&gt;_posts&lt;/code&gt; directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run &lt;code&gt;jekyll serve --watch&lt;/code&gt;, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To add new posts, simply add a file in the &lt;code&gt;_posts&lt;/code&gt; directory that follows the convention &lt;code&gt;YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext&lt;/code&gt; and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;puts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Hi, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;#{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
